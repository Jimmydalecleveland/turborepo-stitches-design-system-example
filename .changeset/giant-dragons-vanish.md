The `Link` and `SpaLink` components have been added, as well as an example of composing `next/link` with `SpaLink` in the web app directory. `Link` is your standard anchor with the design system styles through Vibes. `SpaLink` is intended for usage with single page app frameworks that use a special routing mechanism that doesn't support simple composing with an anchor, such as Next.js v12. You can use whichever is easier in your environment.
