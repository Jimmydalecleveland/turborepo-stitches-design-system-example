`StarRating` component, and its helper components and utility functions, have been added. This includes utility functions for calculating a percentage to a custom star rating (defaulting to 5), which avoids rounding up for fairness reasons. It also includes a `Star` SVG that can have the colored layer path move (i.e. slide) across the gray star background to allow for states inbetween full and half stars. It also includes a `StarRatingGroup` which is used to display the rating text in standard ways without having to setup those layouts and sizing.
