The `Divider` component has been added, which can be used as a standalone or through layout components that are coming soon. It has some really cool functionality built in to allow it to change orientation automatically in flex/grid containers that switch orientation, filling up the space between elements correctly. This was so much harder to do reliably than I thought when I first attempted this.
