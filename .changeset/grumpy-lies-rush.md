The `List` component has been added, which support typical bullet as well as lists with icons and multi-line lists, such as each item having a heading and text body while still wrapping all to the right of the icon/bullet. This is a handy little component that makes use of `Stack` to keep content aligned, respective to the bullet/icon, and allowing control over the horizontal spacing. It uses an SVG for the default `ul` behavior with bullets in order to stay consistent.
