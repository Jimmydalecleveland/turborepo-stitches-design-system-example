I rarely feel ready to release v1, as there is always work to do and who knows what breaking changes are around the corner, but with the revamped theme in this update replacing the placeholder one that existed before, I think it is ready to be considered v1. There isn't actually a breaking change in this update, but the system is useable and stable enough at this point to move forward with the first major release. This theme needs a bit more tweaking, and it is just the default theme (you can customize the theme for this Design System at any level), but it does have enough time put into it to be a good starting point.
