A custom theme example, with dedicated page (`/custom-theme-example`) has been added to the web app. It shows how to override a theme with an entirely different set of colors, as well as fine grain control over how component types use those colors, as well as responsive font size overrides and applying a theme at a specific element (in this example, a single page route).
